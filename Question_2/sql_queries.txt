Question 2: For this question youâ€™ll need to use SQL. Follow this link to access the data set required for the challenge. 
Please use queries to answer the following questions. Paste your queries along with your final numerical answers below.

How many orders were shipped by Speedy Express in total?

There were 54 orders by Speedy Express in total. The query is given below:
SELECT COUNT(a.OrderID) FROM Orders as a 
INNER JOIN Shippers as b ON a.ShipperID = b.ShipperID
WHERE b.ShipperName = 'Speedy Express'

For this query, we count the Order ID to determine how many orders there are since it is the primary key in the Orders table. 
This will thus count the unique number of columns per Shipper. We use the Shipper ID to distinguish between the shippers as this 
is the primary key in the Shippers table. This is preferred over Shipper Name in case there are duplicate names in the database. 
Then, we check where the Shipper Name is Speedy Express, as required.

What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?

The last name of the employee with the most orders is Peacock . The query is given below:

SELECT  a.LastName, COUNT(*) FROM Employees AS a INNER JOIN Orders AS b on a.EmployeeID = b.EmployeeID
GROUP BY a.EmployeeID
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1 

For this query, we want the last name so we look at the last names and the number of orders per customer. This is grouped by the 
employee ID to avoid any duplicate cases of people with the same last name. Lastly, it is limited to the top customer after ordering
by the count column in descending order. 

What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

The product that was ordered the most by customers in Germany is Gorgonzolo Telino. The query is given below: 

SELECT d.ProductName, COUNT(*) FROM Customers AS a 
INNER JOIN ORDERS as b ON a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID
INNER JOIN OrderDetails as c ON b.OrderID = c.OrderID
INNER JOIN Products as d ON c.ProductID = d.ProductID

WHERE a.Country = 'Germany'
GROUP BY c.ProductID
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 1 

For this query, we want the product name and the count which is the number of times that it was ordered. We take the subset of the 
data where the country is Germany, group by Product ID so that the unique products are being considered. Then, it is ordered by the 
count in descending order and limited to one so the top product is shown.
